I am not blogging for a long time, but still this short experience taught me a lot. Here is what I learnt during the process.

The very first thing I learnt is that you don't need a Wordpress site to start a blog. I am using Jekyll as my blogging platform and I love it. I believe it is ten times lighter than Wordpress and it is much more secure. If you are only interested in a lightweight blogging platform then I highly recommend Jekyll.

Having a blog also pushed me to do research on stuff that I wasn't very sure of. I felt responsible of my blog posts so I made enough background search to make sure that the information I share is accurate and correct.

I also loved giving back to the community.

Like thousands of others, I personally love [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com), too. To the untrained eye, Reddit looks like a 90s site. A mess — text links, comment threads, points, upvotes, downvotes. At best, posts seem contextless — at worst, totally random.

But spend some quality time with **"The Front Page of the Internet,"** and you'll find it's an essential resource, a self-correcting marketplace of ideas that's nearly impervious to marketers.

In Reddit there are tens of niche communities, called **Subreddits**.  You can subscribe to those subreddits, which will push popular posts from those channels to your homepage. You can always browse those individual subreddits directly, of course.

So below is a list of all programming related subreddits. Go ahead browse them and subscribe to the ones you find beneficial:

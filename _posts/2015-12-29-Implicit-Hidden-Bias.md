The subconscious mind can influence decision making. Even if you carefully weigh the pros and cons and think that the decision is very logical still you may not beat your subconscious evil twin.

If you want to see what implicit biases and preferences you have, select a test (or more) the <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html" target="_blanks">Project Implicit Website</a>. Because I am a programmer, one of the best starting points for me was the Gender-Science or Gender-Career IAT.

It's no secret that unconscious biases penetrate various realms of society, from hiring decisions to medical care and even foul calls in the NBA.

But what about implicit bias our everyday lives? Does it play a role in the neighborhoods we choose to live in, the establishments we patronize, the shows we watch?

If you think you are not bias then simply answer the following questions:

1. Are your three best friends the same race as you?
2. Do you automatically exclude certain neighborhoods as places you might live or send your kids to school?
3. Do you 'only date' a certain type?
4. Do you have a 'gay friend'? A 'black doctor'?
5. Do you get nervous around muslims?


<h3>What can we do to try to mitigate the impact of implicit biases?</h3>
Here is my humble opinion on this topic.

None of the tests in the world. None of the conferences, TED Talks, YouTube videos in the world would lead to a long-term change. I don't believe that.

The only remedy I know is "Travel The World". Travel to China, Africa, Europe, Asia. Meet as many people as possible. Then may be then we can appreciate the diversity, the different religions and different skin colors.

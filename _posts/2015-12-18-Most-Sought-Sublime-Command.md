Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance.

This is at the top of my favorite Sublime Text features list. Use these keyboard shortcuts to find all instances of a string in a file and then simultaneously edit them. It’s a gem and works in versions 2 and 3 of Sublime Text.

Key to the Keys

⌃ = CTRL key

⌘ = CMD key

### The Keyboard Shortcuts ###

Command: Multi-Select Editing

`MAC => ⌃ + ⌘ + G`

`WINDOWS => ALT + F3`

`LINUX => ALT + F3`

Select any string in your text and then enter the keyboard shortcut. Sublime Text will select all instances of the string in the document and place a cursor at the end of every match. Delete the matched strings and enter something new or append whatever you need to the matched text. Your edits show up at every matched position simultaneously.
